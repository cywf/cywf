# CYWF Analytics Dashboard Upgrade - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds comprehensive enhancements to the CYWF Analytics Dashboard, including new visualizations, interactive features, and an automated data pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Automated Data Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions Workflow** (`.github/workflows/metrics.yml`)
  - Runs every 30 minutes (at :17 and :47 past each hour)
  - Fetches data from GitHub GraphQL API
  - Generates static JSON files in `public/data/`
  - Commits and pushes updates automatically

- **Metrics Fetcher** (`scripts/fetchMetrics.mjs`)
  - Fetches owned and public contributed repositories
  - Calculates activity tallies (commits, PRs, issues, reviews)
  - Generates monthly time series data
  - Approximates activity by hour distribution
  - Fetches public gists with previews
  - Fetches Quote of the Day from ZenQuotes/Quotable
  - Optionally fetches Daily Brief content

### 2. New Visualizations
- **Donut Chart**: Shows PRs vs Issues vs Commits ratio
- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Displays monthly activity trends (last 12 months)
- **Enhanced Activity by Hour**: Alternating bar shades for better readability
- **Language Distribution**: Color-coded by language using GitHub Linguist colors

### 3. Interactive Components
- **Mermaid Diagram Playground**
  - Support for Flowchart, Mind Map, ER, and C4 diagrams
  - Live editing with instant rendering
  - Dark theme integration

- **Latest Gists Panel**
  - Scrollable list of public gists
  - Modal preview with syntax highlighting
  - Direct links to GitHub

- **Daily Brief**
  - Supports Markdown and HTML content
  - Collapsible panel
  - Sanitized rendering with DOMPurify

- **Quote of the Day**
  - Displays inspirational quotes
  - Configurable source (ZenQuotes or Quotable)

### 4. Technical Improvements
- **TypeScript Utilities**
  - `lib/utils/dataClient.ts`: Fetch with stale-while-revalidate caching
  - `lib/utils/palette.ts`: Color management with HSL utilities

- **Chart Components**
  - `components/charts/DonutChart.tsx`
  - `components/charts/StackedBarChart.tsx`
  - `components/charts/ActivityByHourChart.tsx`
  - `components/charts/LanguageDistribution.tsx`

- **Data Files**
  - `public/data/linguist-colors.json`: Language color mappings
  - `public/data/.gitkeep`: Ensures directory is tracked

## Configuration

Set these in GitHub repository settings:

### Variables
- `GH_LOGIN`: Your GitHub username (e.g., "cywf")
- `DAILY_BRIEF_URL`: (Optional) URL to Markdown/HTML file
- `QOTD_SOURCE`: (Optional) "zenquotes" (default) or "quotable"

### Secrets
- `METRICS_TOKEN`: GitHub PAT with scopes:
  - `read:user`
  - `read:gist`
  - `public_repo`

## Privacy & Security

✅ **Public Data Only**: Only public repositories and contributions are displayed
✅ **No Tokens in Browser**: All API calls are server-side via GitHub Actions
✅ **Static Files**: Browser only fetches pre-generated JSON files
✅ **Content Sanitization**: HTML/Markdown is sanitized with DOMPurify
✅ **CodeQL Clean**: No security vulnerabilities detected

⚠️ **CDN Libraries**: Mermaid, Marked, and DOMPurify are loaded from CDN for bundle-free setup. For enhanced security in production, consider adding SRI hashes or bundling locally.

## Code Quality

- ✅ Build succeeds with no errors
- ✅ TypeScript type checking passes
- ✅ ESLint warnings minimized (only acceptable `any` types for dynamic data)
- ✅ Code review feedback addressed:
  - Magic numbers extracted to named constants
  - Cache size limits implemented
  - Modal focus management improved
  - Clear documentation for approximations

## Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflow runs successfully
- [ ] Metrics JSON files are generated correctly
- [ ] Dashboard displays all new visualizations
- [ ] Donut and stacked bar charts render properly
- [ ] Language colors are applied correctly
- [ ] Mermaid playground renders all diagram types
- [ ] Gists panel shows previews and modal works
- [ ] Daily Brief content renders (if configured)
- [ ] Quote of the Day displays correctly
- [ ] Focus management works in modals (Tab, Shift+Tab, Esc)
- [ ] All links open correctly
- [ ] Mobile responsive design works

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Mobile browsers

## Known Limitations

1. **Activity by Hour**: Approximated from contribution calendar since GraphQL doesn't provide commit timestamps. Real distribution would require REST API calls.

2. **Monthly Time Series**: Uses typical ratios (50% commits, 30% PRs, 20% issues) to split contribution counts since calendar doesn't distinguish between types.

3. **CDN Dependencies**: Mermaid, Marked, and DOMPurify are loaded from CDN at runtime. Consider bundling for production.

## Future Enhancements

- Add SRI hashes for CDN scripts
- Implement actual commit timestamp fetching for accurate hourly distribution
- Add more diagram types to Mermaid playground
- Implement client-side search/filter for gists
- Add export functionality for charts (PNG/SVG)
- Implement dark/light theme toggle
- Add animation preferences for reduced motion

## Deployment

1. Ensure all environment variables and secrets are configured
2. Merge PR to main branch
3. GitHub Actions will automatically:
   - Run the metrics workflow
   - Build the Next.js site
   - Deploy to GitHub Pages

## Documentation

- `DASHBOARD_README.md`: Updated with new features, configuration, and privacy notes
- Inline code comments: Added for clarification of approximations and trade-offs
- This summary: Comprehensive implementation overview

## Metrics

- **Files Created**: 19 new files
- **Files Modified**: 3 existing files
- **Lines Added**: ~2,500
- **Build Size**: ~439 KB (main bundle)
- **No Breaking Changes**: Existing features preserved
