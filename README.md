I'm a Developer, Technophile, and Open Source Enthusiast. On an eternal quest to understand the universe, one semicolon at a time. Striving to remain phlegmatic while wrestling with Heisenbugs in the realm of code.

## 🎮 Gaming 🎮

I'm a huge fan of gaming, and I'm currently playing the following games:

- **Minecraft**: Currently building a Nuclear Reactor Turbibe Facility...yes you read that correctly. I'm a nerd, you got me...you can check it out and watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ag0bRABA0Nw&t=101s)
- **Hacknet**: A hacking simulator game that I'm currently playing through.

- **World of Warcraft**: I'm a huge fan of WoW, ever since I was a kid running around Orgrimar with my friends while waiting for PvP BG que's to pop (back then all the good players were alliance so we had to wait a while). I'm always down to run some Mythic+ dungeons or PvP arenas.
- **COD Mobile**: I'm a huge fan of COD Mobile, and I'm currently ranked in the top 1% of all players in the US region, and if you dare to 1v1 me I will show no mercy...unless of course you'd like to join our clan, in which case we should team up and wipe the floor in ranked MP or BR.
