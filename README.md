# 🚀 What up, World! 🚀  
It's me, ya boy Ky1o, also known as **cywf** (cyber wolf). And no, I'm not an actual wolf. Just a cyber one.  
I'm a **Developer**, **Technophile**, and **Open Source Enthusiast** on an eternal quest to understand the universe, one semicolon at a time. Striving to remain phlegmatic while writing code that sparks joy—and occasional bugs.  

## 🌱 Current Activities  
- Building and maintaining automation pipelines that would make Rube Goldberg proud.  
- Educating community members and future guardians of cyberspace via PR‑CYBR and Executive Security International.  
- Exploring emerging paradigms in AI, cybersecurity, space systems and psionics.  
- Working on the G8 System for intergenerational stewardship and resilience.  
- Balancing professional pursuits with personal growth, sustainability, and a small amount of mischief.
