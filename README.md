# Whoami?

Hey there, my name is Kylo. With a passion for Security, an advocate for Privacy, and a proud veteran of the U.S. Army. What I care most about: To protect and defend those who cannot or do not have the means to protect themselves. My "humans first" mindset, means ensuring the security and well being of humans, with the goal being to bridge the gap between generations in the world of technology.
