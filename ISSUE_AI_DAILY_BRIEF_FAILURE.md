# Issue: AI-Powered Daily Brief (Claude) Workflow Failure

**Status:** Open  
**Priority:** High  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Workflow Run:** [#18917282412](https://github.com/cywf/cywf/actions/runs/18917282412/job/54003986278)

---

## Executive Summary

The "AI-Powered Daily Brief (Claude)" workflow failed to execute successfully due to missing authentication credentials. The workflow is designed to generate automated daily brief content using Claude AI, but cannot function without proper API key configuration.

---

## Problem Description

### What Happened

The workflow run [#18917282412](https://github.com/cywf/cywf/actions/runs/18917282412) failed at the "Generate Daily Brief with Claude" step, which uses the `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1` GitHub Action.

### Root Causes Identified

1. **Missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Secret**
   - The workflow expects `secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to be configured
   - Log evidence: `##[debug]Evaluating: secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` → `##[debug]=> null`
   - This is required for the Claude AI API authentication

2. **Prepare Step Failure**
   - The internal "prepare" step of the claude-code-action failed
   - Step outcome: `'failure'` (line: `##[debug]..=> 'failure'`)
   - All subsequent steps that depend on prepare step outputs failed

3. **Token Cleanup Error**
   - A secondary error occurred during cleanup when trying to revoke a GitHub installation token
   - Error: "Bad credentials" (HTTP 401)
   - The cleanup step attempted to use `steps.prepare.outputs.GITHUB_TOKEN` which was `null`
   - Resulting curl command had empty authorization: `"Authorization: Bearer "`

## Technical Details

### Failed Step: "Generate Daily Brief with Claude"

**Action Used:** `anthropics/claude-code-action@v1`

**Required Inputs:**
- `anthropic_api_key`: ❌ **NOT CONFIGURED** (evaluates to empty string)
- `prompt`: ✅ Configured (detailed prompt for generating daily brief content)

**Step Execution Flow:**
1. Prepare step runs internally within the action
2. Prepare step fails due to missing API key
3. Main claude-code execution is skipped (condition: `success()` is false)
4. Cleanup attempt fails with authentication error

### Error Messages

```
{
  "message": "Bad credentials",
  "documentation_url": "https://docs.github.com/rest",
  "status": "401"
}
```

### Affected Workflow File

**Path:** `.github/workflows/ai-daily-brief.yml`

**Trigger:** 
- Schedule: Daily at 10:00 UTC (06:00 Puerto Rico time)
- Manual: `workflow_dispatch`

**Current Run Status:** Completed with failure

---

## Impact

### Current State
- ❌ Daily brief automation is non-functional
- ❌ README.md daily brief section is not being updated
- ❌ Daily archives in `daily/` directory are not being created
- ⚠️ Scheduled runs will continue to fail until fixed

### What Should Be Working
- ✅ Automated daily brief generation with Claude AI
- ✅ README.md updates with:
  - Quote of the day
  - Weather report (San Juan, PR)
  - Space weather status
  - Global intelligence news
  - Cybersecurity news
  - GitHub trending repositories
- ✅ Daily archives saved to `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md`

---

## Solution

### Required Actions

#### 1. Configure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY Secret

**Steps:**
1. Obtain an Anthropic API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Add it to GitHub repository secrets:
   - Go to: `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions`
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - Value: `sk-ant-...` (your actual API key)
   - Click "Add secret"

#### 2. Verify Workflow Permissions

Ensure the workflow has adequate permissions in `.github/workflows/ai-daily-brief.yml`:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: write  # ✅ Already configured
```

#### 3. Test the Workflow

After adding the secret:
1. Navigate to `Actions` → `AI-Powered Daily Brief (Claude)`
2. Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow"
3. Monitor the execution to verify success

## Additional Considerations

### API Usage & Costs

The workflow will make API calls to Anthropic's Claude service:
- **Frequency:** Once daily at 10:00 UTC
- **Model:** Uses default model specified in action (likely Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- **Expected Cost:** Estimated $0.01-0.05 per run (varies by content length)
- **Monthly Estimate:** ~$0.30-1.50

**Recommendation:** Monitor API usage in Anthropic Console to track costs.

### Workflow Schedule

Current schedule:
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 10 * * *'  # 10:00 UTC = 06:00 Puerto Rico time
```

Consider if this timing is optimal for your use case.

### Alternative Solutions

If you prefer not to use paid API services:

1. **Option A:** Use a different free AI service
   - Requires modifying the workflow to use a different action
   - May have rate limits or quality differences

2. **Option B:** Manual updates
   - Remove the automated workflow
   - Update daily brief content manually

3. **Option C:** Simplified automation
   - Use GitHub Actions with free APIs (weather, quotes, news)
   - Generate brief without AI assistance
