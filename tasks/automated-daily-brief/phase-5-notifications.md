# Phase 5 – Optional Notifications & Integrations

## Implementation Complete ✅

### GitHub Actions Summary
- [x] Job summary automatically generated with date, time, and archive path
- [x] Visible in GitHub Actions run output

### Configuration

#### GitHub Actions Summary
Every workflow run includes a summary with:
- Date of generation
- Time of generation (UTC)
- Path to the archive file

### Troubleshooting

**Workflow failures:**
1. Check that all required secrets are configured (`OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`)
2. Verify Node.js environment is set up correctly
3. Review the job summary for specific error details

### Secret Rotation

When rotating secrets:
1. Update the secret value in GitHub repository settings
2. No code changes required - workflow will use new values automatically
3. Test with manual workflow dispatch to verify

### Optional Future Enhancements

These can be added later if needed:
- Issue creation for failed data fetches
- Discord webhook integration
- Email notifications
- Custom webhook for internal systems
